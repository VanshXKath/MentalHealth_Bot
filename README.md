ðŸ§  Sathi â€“ Your Mental Health Companion
Sathi is a compassionate mental health chatbot built using JavaScript and powered by Google's Gemini API. It offers emotional support through real-time chat, mood-based responses, and mindfulness features like guided breathing exercises. The chatbot uses markdown formatting for better readability and maintains chat history for context-aware replies. Users can interact via emoji-based mood buttons or text input, and receive empathetic, helpful responses. The app is styled with animations and dynamically updates the interface for a smooth experience. Sathi is designed to listen, support, and gently encourage well-being â€” without replacing professional mental health care.
